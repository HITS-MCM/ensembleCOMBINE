Description:

Modification of the original COMBINE software to allow the use of multiple structures for one ligand-protein complex.
Two new parameters were introduced in the input file:
- number of structures per ligand-protein complex --- nconf
- type of average to compute: 1-arithmetic; 2-exponential --- iave

This tutorial guides the user through the process of setting up and running COMparative BINding Energy (COMBINE)
analysis to derive a Quantitative Structure-Kinetics Relationship (QSKR) for the dissociation rate constants (koff) of
inhibitors of a protein using more than one structure to represent each inhibitor-protein complex. The procedure is
demonstrated for a dataset of 33 inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase. Each inhibitor-protein complex is represented by 10
structures obtained by ensemble docking to protein configurations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations. The
tutorial will follow the procedure described in the paper XX, but with much simplification.

Content of directories

Directory 'code' contains files:
- combine.exe: executable to perform COMBINE analysis
- combine.f: source code of COMBINE analysis in Fortran
- combine.o
- Makefile  
- param.h

Directory 'p38' contains files:
- 8-lig1.crd to 80-lig36.crd: 330 coordinate files for kinase-inhibitor complexes generated by the LEaP program of Amber
  14; naming scheme: XX-ligYY.crd, where XX refers to the protein configuration and YY refers to the ligand;
- 8-lig1.top to 80-lig36.top: 330 topology files for kinase-inhibitor complexes generated by the LEaP program of Amber
  14 using ff14SB and GAFF force fields for the protein and inhibitors, respectively; 
- combine.in: input file with parameters to perform COMBINE analysis.

Directory 'output' contains files: 
- combine.cff
- combine.dat
- energy_values.dat
- predict1.dat to predict10.dat
- table1.dat
These files are explained in step 4.

Steps

1- decompress the directory 'example-git'
In the directory containing the zip file:
> unzip example-git.zip
> cd example-git

2- compilation of code
This step is optional, as the file 'combine.exe' is already available.
> cd code
> make
> cd ..

3- run COMBINE
Topology files for the structures were prepared using AMBER, and ligand-protein structures were previously energy
minimized using AMBER. For a detailed description of how to prepare topology files and energy minimize structures,
please see:
https://kbbox.h-its.org/toolbox/tutorials/generation-of-quantitative-structure-kinetics-relationships-qskrs-using-comparative-binding-energy-combine-analysis/
Here, we will use previously prepared AMBER topology and coordinate files for 330 energy-minimized kinase-inhibitor structures.
The file combine.in describes the parameters to perform COMBINE analysis. The parameters are:
- line 1: column 1 indicates if activities should be randomized (0-no; 1-yes); column 2 indicates if scaling of
experimental activities should be performed (0-no; 1-yes); column 3 indicates if the interaction matrix should be
calculated (0) or read from a file (1). 
- line 2: column 1 contains the maximum number of latent variables to use (in this case, 10); column 2 indicates the
method to calculate electrostatic interactions (0-constant dielectric, 1-images model from Goodford, 2-distance
dependent dielectric constant, 3-Poisson-Boltzmann electrostatics, read from a file, 4-Sigmoidal dielectric function);
column 3 contains the dielectric constant to calculate electrostatic interactions (in this case, 4).
- line 3: column 1 indicates absence (0) or presence (1) of extra descriptors (for example, solvent accessible surface
areas or entropies); column 2 indicates the number of extra descriptors per complex.
- line 4: column 1 contains the number of inhibitors in the training set (in this case, 22); column 2 contains the number
of inhibitors in the test set (in this case, 11).
- line 5: column 1 indicates the treatment for positive energy values (0-none, 1-zero positive van der Waal energy values,
2-zero positive electrostatic energy values, 3-zero all positive energy values); column 2 contains a cutoff to
eliminate interaction energies; all energies with standard deviation below the cutoff are not considered in the analysis.
- line 6: column 1 indicates the method to perform cross-validation (0-consecutive groups of inhibitors; 1-random groups of
inhibitors); column 2 contains the number of inhibitors to remove in cross-validation. 
- line 7: column 1 contains the number of structures to describe one ligand-protein complex (in this case, 10); column 2
contains the type of average to perform to obtain one prediction from many structures (1-arithmetic; 2-exponential).
- lines 8-337: column 1 contains the name of the topology file, without extension; names referring to the same ligand
should be grouped together; column 2 contains the code to designate the ligand in the topology file (in this case, INH);
column 3 contains the experimental activity for the kinase-inhibitor complex (in this case, log koff); column 4 on wards
(optional) contains extra descriptors.
After line 7, the first 220 complexes (22 inhibitors, each represented by 10 structures) will be attributed to the
training set, and the following 110 complexes (11 inhibitors, each represented by 10 structures) will be attributed to
the test set.

To run COMBINE analysis:
> cd p38
> ../code/combine.exe -i combine.in -o combine.out

4- comparison with expected results
Several output files were generated. We will describe some of them here.
You can compare the results you obtained with the ones available in the directory 'output'.
- combine.cff: weight or coefficient for every energy component. The first 3 columns show the residue, the number of the
residue and the type of interaction energy (vdw for van der Waals energy, ele for electrostatics energy). The other 10
columns show the coefficients for models obtained using from 1 to 10 latent variables.
- combine.dat: interaction energies between the inhibitor and each residue in the protein for all inhibitor-protein complexes.
van der Waals interaction energies are shown first, then electrostatic interaction energies are shown. Below the
complex name, there are three columns: the interaction energy, the residue name and the residue number.
- energy_values.dat: same information as in combine.dat. Below the complex name, there are two columns: the residue
number and the interaction energy.
- predict1.dat to predict10.dat: predictions for the training, test and cross-validation sets for models
obtained using 1 to 10 latent variables. The first 22 lines show the complexes in the training set, and the last 11
lines show the complexes in the test set. In the training set, the first four columns show the name of the ligand, the
experimental activity, the activity obtained in the training set and the predicted activity in the cross-validation. In
the test set, the first three columns show the name of the ligand, the experimental activity and the predicted
activity.
- table1.dat: statistical measures for models obtained using 1 to 10 latent variables. The 10 columns show: number of latent
variables, coefficient of determination for the training set, coefficient of determination for the cross-validation
set, average absolute errors for training set and cross-validation set, root mean squared errors for training set and
cross-validation set, coefficient of determination for the test set, average absolute error and root mean squared error
for the test set.

Description:

Modification of the original COMBINE software to allow the use of multiple structures for one ligand-protein complex.
Two new parameters were introduced in the input file:
- number of structures per ligand-protein complex --- nconf
- type of average to compute: 1-arithmetic; 2-exponential --- iave
